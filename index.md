## Manjunath Nagaraj Shettar

I aspire to become an Artist in Software/Data Engineering who can transform the ideas to products with human touch.

Anything which can be built from 0 to 1 and scaled at level intrigues me. My areas of interest broadly lie in designing and developing software products in BigData , Cloud and Database systems.I enjoyed working as a BigData application software developer at Cisco Systems for 2 years.

I have worked on interesting projects like Recommender Systems, Data Deduplication on Data Platforms like Hadoop which helped me understand the underlying architectures of Apache Spark,Apache Hive,Apache Solr frameworks and UNIX environment.

I am a great believer in the quote "When you reach your limits ,Your limits expand" and an admirer of Steve Jobs!
