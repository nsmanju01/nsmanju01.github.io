## Manjunath Nagaraj Shettar

# I aspire to become an Artist in Software/Data Engineering who can transform the ideas to products with human touch.

I am a Master's student at UW-Madison in the Dept. of Computer Sciences expected to graduate on Dec - 2018.

Anything which can be built from 0 to 1 and scaled at level intrigues me. My areas of interest broadly lie in designing and developing software products in BigData , Cloud and Database systems.I enjoyed working as a BigData application software developer at Cisco Systems for 2 years.

I am a great believer in the quote "When you reach your limits ,Your limits expand" and an admirer of Steve Jobs!
